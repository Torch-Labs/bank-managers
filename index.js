/**
 * Requirement
 *
 * We have a database of bank managers, where each contains a list of bank account IDs which they manage.
 *
 * There also exists a database of bank accounts which conaitins all the accounts our managers manage and more.
 * This database also has the information for a account which we do not have.
 * https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Torch-Labs/bank-database/master/bank_info.json
 *
 * Based on the request query for a manager, we need to get the account information from the large database and send
 * a JSON response with a list containing the account information of the accounts the manager manages.
 *
 * All accounts the managers manage also exist in the database.
 * Assume all data is dynamic so we cannot store any data locally.
